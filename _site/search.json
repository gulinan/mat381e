This course is an introductory level data science course on introducing different data types (structured and unstructured) from different fields arising mostly from digital technologies or available on the web, and then focusing on importing, cleaning, reshaping, exploring, and visualizing these data.\nComputer skills:\nWe will be using R programming language with RStudio IDE for data related works. You will prepare your all works (reports and presentations) in R Markdown, which closely follows Markdown syntax. You will also be using the version control system Git along with GitHub to submit homework assignments and team-based works through GitHub classroom of our course. You will publish your final project on GitHub pages. Lastly, prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript brings a big plus to produce fancy outputs for your works. But it is neither a must nor focus of this course.\nCourse website: For each study, you will also receive an invitation soon to submit your study to the GitHub Classroom of the following organization:\nhttps://github.com/MAT381E-Fall21.\nClass Schedule: Mondays between 14:30-17:30 p.m. (Local time in Istanbul).\nClassroom: Online via secured ITU Zoom platform.\nCourse Logistics: Each week, before the class, a Zoom meeting invitation will be sent you via your ITU email to join the class on Mondays. Lectures will be automatically recorded and you will have a chance re-watch the videos after the class on https://ninova.itu.edu.tr. Lecture materials (notes, assignments, grades etc) will be uploaded on https://ninova.itu.edu.tr.\nCourse Objectives: This course aims to:\nProvide basic knowledge required for using data science computational tools such as a programming language and its packages associated with data science, a dynamic report application, and version control system.\nIntroduce different types of data from different disciplines arising from digital technologies or available on the web.\nTo give an ability for accessing, cleaning, reshaping, exploring, and visualizing different types of data from different disciplines.\nTo give an ability for interpreting data arising from different disciplines and making data-driven inferences.\nCourse Tentative Plan: We will closely follow the weekly schedule given below. However, weekly class schedules are subject to change depending on the progress we make as a class.\n\nWeek\nDate\nTopic\n\n1\n04/10\nIntroduction to data science and computational tools.

Users without a library account should apply for the library registration at https://kutuphane.itu.edu.tr/en/register. After setting the web configurations given at https://kutuphane.itu.edu.tr/en/services /web-browser-proxy-settings only once on your computer, you will able to have an access to ITU Library e-sources.\nSelected Important Dates: For the official ITU Fall 2021 academic calendar, please visit:\nhttps://www.sis.itu.edu.tr/TR/ogrenci/akademik-takvim/akademik-takvimler/takvim2022/lisans-akademik-takvimi.php\nHere are some selected important dates in Fall 2021 semester:\nOctober 4, 2021: First day of classes.\nOctober 4-8, 2021: Add-drop week.\nOctober 29, 2021: Republic Day of Turkey (Friday, No classes).\nNovember 22-26, 2021: ITU Fall Break (No classes).\nJanuary 1, 2022: New year (Saturday).\nJanuary 14, 2022: Last day of classes.\nJanuary 17-30, 2022: Final exam week.\nI also honor other national and religous holidays.

However, I reserve the right to assign different grades to each team member based on peer evaluations (see below).\nEach team member should contribute to oral presentation where the allocated time is evenly distributed among the team members. If any member of the team fails to do oral presentation, that individual will receive ‚Äú0‚Äù for oral presentation grade.\nThe peer evaluation point of a student will be the average of the points which his/her team members will assign to him/her.\nIf any member for a specific team fails to submit the peer evaluation form, all members of that team will receive ‚Äú0‚Äù for peer evaluation grade.\nFor detailed information on project design guideline and related documents, please see the relevant document on Ninova.\nEvery study mentioned above should be submitted by each student via GitHub Classroom of MAT381E-Fall21 organization.\nLate Submission Policy: Students are expected to do homework assignments by themselves. Neither homework assignments nor team-based works will be accepted after deadline. There are NO make-ups for missed homework and team-based works. The students who have Covid-19 medical report during the submission periods can ask for extension only.\nFinal Exam Attendance Policy: None.\nMake-Up Exam Policy: Not applicable this semester.\nClass Attendance Policy:\nThe students must attend at least 70% of classes and are deemed responsible to manage his/her absences.\nParticipation Policy:\nThe students are expected to ask and answer questions, participate in in-class activities, and show their interest and engagement in the class.\nE-mail Policy:\nPlease:\nUse a proper descriptive subject line (which may consist of the course number MAT381E followed by a short phrase summarizing the subject of your e-mail).\nStart off your e-mail with a proper greeting, introduce yourself (give your name), then state your problem as short as possible.\nFinally, use a proper closing and then finish your e-mail with your first name and so on.\nFeel free to send me e-mails. But be sure you that give me enough time to get back to you. In the past, I have had pretty much tolerance for e-mail messages sent after business hours and at weekends. But, now, due to pandemic, I should say that I may not appreciate these e-mails anymore. Lastly, e-mails asking for grade grubbing at the end of the semester are not welcomed.\nEquity, Diversity, and Inclusion:\nIn this class, I am committed to cultural and individual differences and diversity as including, but not limited to, age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, language, national origin, race, religion, culture, and socioeconomic status and I acknowledge the value of differences.\nAcademic Honesty Policy:\nAt every stage of the academic life, every ITU student is responsible for obeying the academic honesty policy of ITU stated below:\nhttps://odek.itu.edu.tr/en/code-of-honor/ethics-in-university-life.\nStudent with Special Needs:\nIf you are a student with special needs, let me know that how we can adjust the course environment and materials in accordance with your needs. Furthermore, you are also invited to contact the office of students with special needs at:\nhttp://engelsiz.itu.edu.tr/.\nITU Distance Education Policy:\nSharing the lecture recordings or its piece with third parties is strictly forbidden. Furthermore, the recordings are subject to investigation by the authorities as needed. For that reason, be sure that you behave (both orally and verbally) responsibly in this virtual class.
